# Part 4: Miscellaneous

**Part 4** contains several stages which demonstrate various mostly-unrelated
features.

## Stages

**Part 4A** demonstrates how an application can use multiple hardware threads to implement the FIR filter in a simple, synchronous, parallel way.

**Part 4B** introduces the `lib_xcore_math` [Digital Filter API](TODO), and how to implement the filter using this API.

**Part 4C** shows how one of the digital filter conversion scripts provided with `lib_xcore_math` can be used to simplify filter implementation and usage even further.
