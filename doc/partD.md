# Part D: Miscellaneous

**Part D** contains several stages which demonstrate various mostly-unrelated
features.

## Stages

**Stage 9** demonstrates how an application can use multiple hardware threads to implement the FIR filter in a simple, synchronous, parallel way.

**Stage 10** introduces the `lib_xcore_math` [Digital Filter API](TODO), and how to implement the filter using this API.

**Stage 11** shows how one of the digital filter conversion scripts provided with `lib_xcore_math` can be used to simplify filter implementation and usage even further.
