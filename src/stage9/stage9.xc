 * In this case, the work will be divided by index range of the BFP vectors.
 * Because there are 1024 taps and 4 threads, the first worker thread will 
 * compute the dot product of the first 256 elements of the two vectors, the
 * second will compute the dot product of elements 256-512, etc.
 * 
 * NOTE: In the comments below I refer to "master thread" and "worker threads".
 *       To avoid confusion I should specify what I'm calling the "master 
 *       thread" is the hardware thread on which this function was called, and 
 *       while in the context of the 'par' block below, the master thread is
 *       also used as one of the 4 worker threads.
